# Sparta Global Academy Homework - JavaScript Rock Paper Scissors

## Project Review:

### In this project I had to create a game based of ROCK-PAPER-SCISSORS using the JavaScript skills currently reviewed. In this case the new feature that was revised was "Functions".

## Project Download:  
### Download from the files created and transferred to GITHUB
### The repository was created on GITHUB and cloned to access from terminal  
### Used a JS file & HTML file

## Using JavaScript tools such as:
```JavaScript
function gamePlay(pChoice, cChoice)
{

else if (pChoice == "ROCK" && cChoice == "SCISSORS")
{
  playerScore++;
  alert("<RockPaperScissors> Player Beats Computer");
  alert("<RockPaperScissors> Player has Selected " + pChoice + " | Computer has Selected " + cChoice + " - Player Score: " + playerScore + " | Computer Score " + comScore)
  pChoice = "";
  cChoice = "";
}}

var rand = comChoice[Math.floor(Math.random() * comChoice.length)];
cChoice = rand;
```

## Using the function command I can pass inputs through parameters that take the value I assign to it. The game consisted of a user picking out of the three choices of input (Rock Paper Scissors). Whereas the computer is given a random function that selects the commands from an array list. Using a WHILE loop was helpful because it keeps the flow of the program continuing until the game is complete. The swtich statement made the procedures clearer.
